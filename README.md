# synthesiser

This is a project I'm undertaking to create a basic synthersiser in C++ using the JUCE framework.
I plan on initially creating a very barebones synth, and then iterating on it to expand it's range of feature.

Currently, the basic backend is mostly in place, with the linkage to connect to the (not-yet-built) GUI.
